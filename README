Airstrike alpha 2

Note that the game is not finished. You can fly around and shoot
things, try out the physics engine etc, but the game is very
repetitive. For installation instructions see INSTALL, for (a little)
code documentation see doc/code.txt and doc/how-it-works.txt

When in the game press ESC for a menu. The game should never crash. If
it does then please send a gdb backtrace to uekstrom@gmail.com. You can
check the debug output on stdout and stderr to see if there is a
problem with the data files, or maybe some other error.

There are a few user-configurable options in the file 'airstrikerc',
see that file for more information. At the moment you must edit this
file to turn on sound or to select graphics 'quality'.

See NOTES for more release related info. For things that need to be
done, see doc/TODO.

You can help! If you are good at Povray, have some nice sound effects
to contribute, like to write some (networking?) code or just have some
ideas, please email uekstrom@gmail.com.
